# estetica
_estetica - aesthetics, study of beauty, especially in arts; to pay attention to the aesthetics; love and appreciation of art and beauty_

estetica is a curation model that will be used by stet.art and the stet community of curators to create a network of NFT art exhibitions that will have the same permanence and provenance attributes of NFTs... because an estetica exhibit will also be an NFT. The model may involve Token Curated Registries concepts as well.

More information will be provided soon.
